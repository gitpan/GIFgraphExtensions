This package relies on the MRP bundle and extends GIFgraph.

To install, first install MRP and GIFgraph. Then cd to the directory that contains
this README file and type the following:

 perl Makefile.PL

If you wish to install this bundle somewhere other than the default
location then type something like:

 perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl

Then to build run make

 make

You can then test the module with

 make test

If you have write access to the install directory (or the one
specified by PREFIX) then you can now type:

 make install

Presuming that the install target is in your PERL5LIB path then you
are now ready to use GIFgraph::WithMap and
GIFgraph::EvenlySpaced. Enjoy!
